# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Timothy!

I'm a passionate **backend developer** based in **South Korea** who believes that growing together is a more impactful and lasting path to development than growing individually.  

Because of my interest in growing together, I was selected as a **Culture Committee member** and continue to contribute to our collaborative work environment.
