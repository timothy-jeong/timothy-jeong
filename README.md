# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Timothy!

I'm a passionate **backend developer** based in **South Korea** who believes that growing together is a more impactful and lasting path to development than growing individually.  
I enjoy sharing knowledge with people, which fuels my drive to review, document, and share the work I do. In 2024, I was recognized as the most active contributor to Confluence documentation at my work.

Because of my interest in growing together, I was selected as a **Culture Committee member** and continue to contribute to our collaborative work environment.
